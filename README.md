# Predicting-Housing-Value-with-Keras-API-ANN

## Objective
To build a deep-learning regression model using Keras API that can predict median housing value based on location, ocean proximity, median age, total rooms, total bedrooms, population size, number of households, and median income.

## Model Evaluation
The model performs with the following metrics:
- Mean absolute error: 38737.4492
- Root mean squared error: 55634.4648
- R-squared: 0.7678
